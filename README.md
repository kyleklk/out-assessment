# Outsurance Technical Assessment
An application to parse and sort contact CSV data, it outputs the following two files:
- A list of distinct names (including first and last name) as well as their frequency, sorted by frequency decending and name ascending
- A list of addresses sorted alphabetically by street name

I followed the test driven development methododology as well as adhered to the SOLID principles 

I decided not to implement a di container or mocking framework due to the simplicity of the program.
The code has been structure in such a manner that to implement one would be trivial.

Thank you for this opportunity.
